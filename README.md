# Voice-Controller

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required libraries 

First run `mic_test.py` to check if Python can get data from the Microphone

Then run `speaker_test.py` to check if Python can speak

Say "STOP" to stop the loop. 

Maybe we could change the code so that the user speaks when a button is pressed or something similar
